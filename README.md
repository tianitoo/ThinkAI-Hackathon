# Personalizing a Text-to-Image Diffusion Model on Moroccan Concepts or Style

## Description
This project is a part of a hackathon organized by THINKIA. The goal is to personalize a text-to-image diffusion model on Moroccan concepts or style. The project aims to create a model that can generate images based on textual descriptions of Moroccan concepts or style.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes a collection of images of Moroccan concepts or style. The dataset was curated from various online sources and was preprocessed before being used for training.

## Training the Model
The text-to-image diffusion model was trained using PyTorch. The model was trained on a GPU for faster processing. The training process included preprocessing the dataset, training the model, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Results
The trained model was able to generate images that closely resembled the given textual descriptions. The generated images were evaluated using various metrics such as structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

## Future Work
Future work includes improving the model's performance and expanding the dataset to include more diverse concepts and styles from Morocco.
